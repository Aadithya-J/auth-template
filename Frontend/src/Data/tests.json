    "testName": "Reading Proficiency Assessment",
    "About": "The Schonell Test measures a child's reading level by assessing their ability to read and pronounce words of increasing difficulty. It identifies a child's 'reading age' and helps tailor educational strategies, especially for those needing extra support. The relaxed test environment ensures accurate assessment of true reading skills. Scoring is based on correctly read words, with norms to classify the child's reading age and academic needs."

    "id": 2,
    "testName": "Visual Discrimination",
    "About": "This test measures a child's ability to distinguish between similar visual items, crucial for reading and writing. Children match letters and words with their identical pairs, helping improve reading skills. It's especially important for children with dyslexia to differentiate confusing letters or numbers, enhancing fluency and academic success."

  {
    "id": 3,
    "testName": "Sound Discrimination",
    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to hear differences between similar-sounding words, vital for reading and spelling. Level 1 focuses on children aged 5 to 7, and Level 2 targets older children with more complex distinctions. Scoring is based on correct identification, helping highlight phonetic weaknesses that may affect literacy."

    "id": 4,
    "testName": "Picture Recognition",
    "About": "The Picture Recognition Test assesses a student’s visual memory and recall abilities by showing a series of images for a brief duration, followed by a task where students must identify those images from a larger set that includes distractors. This test is useful in measuring memory retention, focus, and recognition accuracy. Scoring is based on the number of correctly identified pictures, helping educators understand the learner’s visual memory strength and recognition capabilities."

    "testName": "Grapheme/Phoneme Correspondence",
    "About":"This test assesses a child's ability to correctly recognize and pronounce individual letters of the alphabet, establishing the crucial connection between written graphemes and their corresponding spoken phonemes. It is designed to detect common letter confusions and support early identification of reading and pronunciation difficulties."

  {
    "id": 6,
    "testName": "Auditory sequential memory",
    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to remember and repeat a sequence of sounds or words. It is crucial for language development, reading, and spelling. The test consists of two levels: Level 1 focuses on simple sequences, while Level 2 presents more complex patterns. Children are asked to listen to a series of sounds or words and then repeat them in the correct order. This helps identify auditory processing strengths and weaknesses."
  },
  {
    "id": 7 ,
    "testName": "Sequence Arrangement",
    "About": "The Sequence Arrangement Test evaluates a student's memory and cognitive organization skills by presenting a random sequence of images or events and requiring the student to rearrange them into their original, logical order. This test assesses short-term memory, attention to detail, and sequencing ability, which are crucial for comprehension and problem-solving. The test is conducted in a calm environment to ensure accurate assessment. Scoring is based on the number of correctly placed items in the sequence, helping educators identify memory strengths and areas that may need reinforcement."

  {
    "id": 8 ,
    "testName": "Symbol Sequence",
    "About": "The Symbol Sequence Test measures a student’s short-term memory, pattern recognition, and sequential processing skills. In this test, students are shown a sequence of abstract symbols for a limited time. After the sequence disappears, they are asked to recreate it in the same order. The test is designed to evaluate attention span and visual memory. Scoring is based on the number of symbols correctly recalled and arranged in sequence, aiding in the assessment of cognitive processing and memory development."
  },
  {
    "id": 9 ,
    "testName": "Sound Blending",
    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to blend individual sounds into words, a key skill for reading and spelling. It consists of two levels: Level 1 focuses on simple three-sound blends, while Level 2 presents more complex blends. Children listen to separate sounds and are asked to combine them to form a word. This helps identify phonemic awareness and blending skills."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "testName": "Vocabulary Scale",
    "About": "This test requires the child to define, or indicate an understanding of, a series of graded words, typically verbally. The first nine words are common first-reader words to gauge readiness. Graded words start from word 10. The tester speaks each word, asks for its meaning, and may use encouragement without prompting. The test stops after five consecutive incorrect responses. Scoring is based on the total number of correctly defined words, which corresponds to a vocabulary age."
