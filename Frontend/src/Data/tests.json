    "testName": "Visual Discrimination",
    "About": "This test measures a child's ability to distinguish between similar visual items, crucial for reading and writing. Children match letters and words with their identical pairs, helping improve reading skills. It's especially important for children with dyslexia to differentiate confusing letters or numbers, enhancing fluency and academic success."

    "id": 3,
    "testName": "Sound Discrimination",
    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to hear differences between similar-sounding words, vital for reading and spelling. Level 1 focuses on children aged 5 to 7, and Level 2 targets older children with more complex distinctions. Scoring is based on correct identification, helping highlight phonetic weaknesses that may affect literacy."

    "testName": "Picture Recognition",
    "About": "This test assesses a child's ability to recognize and name familiar objects based on visual cues. The test is divided into two levels: Level 1 presents simple, easy-to-identify images, while Level 2 introduces more complex pictures to challenge recognition skills. The child is asked to identify the image and describe its meaning, with responses recorded in audio or written form. This test helps evaluate visual perception, language development, and cognitive association skills."

    "testName": "Grapheme/Phoneme Correspondence",
    "About":"This test assesses a child's ability to correctly recognize and pronounce individual letters of the alphabet, establishing the crucial connection between written graphemes and their corresponding spoken phonemes. It is designed to detect common letter confusions and support early identification of reading and pronunciation difficulties."

    "testName": "Auditory sequential memory",
    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to remember and repeat a sequence of sounds or words. It is crucial for language development, reading, and spelling. The test consists of two levels: Level 1 focuses on simple sequences, while Level 2 presents more complex patterns. Children are asked to listen to a series of sounds or words and then repeat them in the correct order. This helps identify auditory processing strengths and weaknesses."

    "About": "This test evaluates a child's ability to blend individual sounds into words, a key skill for reading and spelling. It consists of two levels: Level 1 focuses on simple three-sound blends, while Level 2 presents more complex blends. Children listen to separate sounds and are asked to combine them to form a word. This helps identify phonemic awareness and blending skills."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "testName": "Vocabulary Scale",
    "About": "This test requires the child to define, or indicate an understanding of, a series of graded words, typically verbally. The first nine words are common first-reader words to gauge readiness. Graded words start from word 10. The tester speaks each word, asks for its meaning, and may use encouragement without prompting. The test stops after five consecutive incorrect responses. Scoring is based on the total number of correctly defined words, which corresponds to a vocabulary age."
