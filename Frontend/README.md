# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I have changed these files to make the test6 work 

- handleSubmit function in test6.jsx
- added /test6 route in the testController.jsx
- store the reference String in the Database as "testData" (check testController.jsx)
- did changes in the aftertest.jsx to display the correct, incorrectwords and the score
